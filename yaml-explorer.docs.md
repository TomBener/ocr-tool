YAML Explorer is a browser-based tool for visualizing and exploring YAML data structures. Users can input YAML content directly by pasting into the textarea or load a YAML file from a URL. The explorer converts YAML to a collapsible tree view with syntax highlighting for different data types (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.). Users can expand and collapse nested objects and arrays, with an "expand all" option for viewing the complete structure. The tool preserves the state of your exploration through the URL, allowing you to share specific views of the YAML data. If there are parsing errors, they will be displayed with helpful error messages.
