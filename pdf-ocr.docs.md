This page functions as an automatic redirect to the OCR service. When a user lands on this page, they will be instantly redirected to the "/ocr" location. The page includes a fallback message with a clickable link in case the automatic redirect fails to work. The redirect happens through the meta refresh tag with a zero-second delay, ensuring immediate redirection for most browsers and devices.
