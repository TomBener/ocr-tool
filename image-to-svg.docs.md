This tool converts JPG or PNG images to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format using the imagetracerjs library. You can upload an image by either dragging and dropping it onto the designated area or clicking to browse your files. Once processed, the tool displays the resulting SVG image and provides the corresponding SVG code in a text area below. The code can be copied to your clipboard with a single click using the "Copy to clipboard" button. The conversion happens entirely in your browser, making it a convenient way to vectorize raster images without requiring server uploads or additional software.
