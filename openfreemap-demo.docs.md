This demonstration showcases the integration of MapLibre GL with OpenFreeMap tiles to render a map of San Francisco with 1,000 randomly generated markers. The code provides three different approaches for rendering multiple markers efficiently: scaling built-in markers, creating custom HTML markers, and using a circle layer. The demo currently implements the circle layer approach, which offers better performance for large numbers of markers by rendering them directly as a map layer rather than as DOM elements. The map is centered on San Francisco, tilted at a 50-degree pitch angle, and automatically fits its bounds to contain all markers with padding. The random markers are confined within a bounding box approximating San Francisco's geographic boundaries.
