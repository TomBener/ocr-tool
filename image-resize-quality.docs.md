This tool allows you to analyze and compare image compression results with different quality settings and resolutions. Upload an image by dragging and dropping, clicking to select, or pasting from your clipboard. The application processes your image at original size and half size, each with five different quality levels (100%, 90%, 70%, 50%, and 30%). For images with transparency, a background color picker appears so you can choose what fills transparent areas when converting to JPEG. Each processed variation displays its width, quality setting, and file size in kilobytes. Click any image to toggle between normal and full-width view. Download links are provided for each variation, allowing you to save the compressed versions for your projects.
