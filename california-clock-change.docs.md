This page displays information about Daylight Saving Time changes for California (Pacific Time zone only). It shows when clocks last changed and when they will change next, indicating whether you'll gain or lose an hour of sleep. For the week following a time change, it includes a note about how pets might be confused by the schedule shift, showing both the current time and what your pet's "internal clock" might perceive. The page automatically detects if you're in the Pacific Time zone and shows a warning if you're not. It updates in real-time and highlights when a clock change is happening tonight. The current time status (whether you're in PST or PDT) is also displayed at the bottom of the page.
