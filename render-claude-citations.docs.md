This tool enables you to render JSON responses from Claude with citation formatting. Paste JSON containing Claude's response into the text area and click "Render message" to display a formatted version with citations properly highlighted as blockquotes. The tool parses the JSON structure, extracts the text content and any citations, then renders them in a sandboxed iframe for security. The renderer supports Claude's standard citation format where cited text appears as indented blockquotes beneath the corresponding paragraphs. The page comes pre-loaded with a sample JSON response demonstrating various citation patterns from an AI trends analysis. This utility helps when working with Claude's API responses or when you need to visualize cited content in a more readable format.
