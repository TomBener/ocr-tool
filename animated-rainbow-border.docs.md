This page demonstrates an interactive animated rainbow border effect. The main element is a dark-colored box with text that can display a colorful animated border when activated. The animation consists of a gradient rainbow effect that flows around the border while pulsing with varying brightness and blur. Users can toggle the animation on or off using the button below the box. When activated, the button text changes to "Stop Animation" and when deactivated, it returns to "Start Animation." The animation uses CSS transitions, keyframes for the gradient movement and pulsing effect, and JavaScript to handle the toggle functionality. The design features a dark background with contrasting elements for visual appeal.
