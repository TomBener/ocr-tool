This tool provides a live rendering environment for Markdown and LaTeX mathematical expressions. Users can type or paste content in the input area, which automatically renders in the preview section below. The renderer supports Markdown formatting such as headings, bold text, italics, lists, and tables, along with mathematical expressions in both inline ($...$) and block ($$...$$) formats using KaTeX. The generated HTML output appears in a separate text area, which can be copied to the clipboard with a single button click. The interface displays both the rendered content and its corresponding HTML code simultaneously, making it useful for content creation and educational purposes.
