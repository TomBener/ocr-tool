This web application provides an interface to interact with Google's Gemini AI models. Users can select from different Gemini model versions including 2.0-flash-exp, 1.5-pro, 1.5-flash, and 1.5-flash-8b. The app requires a Gemini API key, which it stores in local storage for convenience. Messages are displayed in a scrollable chat area with markdown support, allowing for formatted responses. When sending a message, the application streams the model's response in real time and displays usage metadata and API call duration. The chat history is maintained within the session but can be reset using the Clear button. The interface includes a text input area and controls for sending messages, changing models, and clearing the conversation history.
