The Writing Style Analyzer helps improve your writing by identifying three common issues in text: weasel words, passive voice constructions, and duplicate words. To use the tool, paste your writing into the text area and receive immediate feedback. The analyzer highlights instances of vague "weasel words" (like "various" or "extremely"), passive voice constructions that may weaken your prose, and accidentally repeated words. Each issue is displayed with surrounding context to help you understand where and how to revise. The analyzer processes text in real-time as you type, allowing for continuous refinement of your writing. This tool is adapted from Matt Might's shell scripts for writing improvement.
