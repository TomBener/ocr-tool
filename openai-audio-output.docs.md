This tool interfaces with OpenAI's GPT-4o audio API to generate text-to-speech responses. Users can enter both a system prompt and a user prompt, select a model version (GPT-4o mini audio preview or GPT-4o audio preview), and choose from various voice options. After clicking "Generate Speech," the application sends a request to the OpenAI API and displays the resulting audio with playback controls, a download button, and a transcript of the spoken content. The complete API response is shown in JSON format with copy functionality. Users can also save responses as GitHub Gists by authenticating with their GitHub account, providing shareable links to both the raw data and an audio player. The tool requires an OpenAI API key, which is stored in local browser storage.
