This page provides an interface to record audio, transcribe it, and process it using OpenAI's GPT-4o audio model. Users can record audio using their microphone by clicking the "Start Recording" button, and the page displays a timer during recording. After stopping, the audio is available for playback and download. Users can add a text prompt in the text area to provide context or instructions for the AI. When submitting to the API, the page processes both the audio and text prompt through OpenAI's API and displays the response in a formatted view. The interface shows token usage details and approximate cost for the API call. The page requires an OpenAI API key, which is stored in the browser's local storage for convenience. All audio processing happens client-side before being sent to the API as a base64-encoded WAV file.
