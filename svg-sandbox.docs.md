This page demonstrates how to embed SVG images in HTML using base64 data URIs. The demonstration includes three examples: a simple sun SVG, a stylized pelican shape, and an SVG with JavaScript (which is intentionally inactive). The page features a responsive grid layout that displays each SVG with a title and description. Below the examples, a footer note explains that SVGs embedded via `img` tags with base64 data URIs have their JavaScript and interactive elements safely ignored by the browser. The page also includes functionality that decodes and displays the raw SVG code for each example, helping users understand how the base64 encoding works.
