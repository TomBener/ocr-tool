This page allows you to create a WebRTC audio session with OpenAI's real-time voice models. Enter your OpenAI API token, select a voice (Ash, Ballad, Coral, Sage, or Verse), and click "Start Session" to begin a conversation. The interface displays detailed token usage statistics for both the current interaction and the entire session, including audio input tokens, text tokens, cached tokens, and their associated costs. A visual audio indicator shows when your microphone is active. The session events section at the bottom logs all events received during the conversation, providing technical details about the interaction. The page securely stores your API token in your browser's local storage for convenience.
