This tool allows you to analyze and understand SQLite queries through the APSW (Another Python SQLite Wrapper) extension. Enter your SQL query in the main text area, and optionally add setup SQL statements in the collapsible section to create tables or other database objects. You can provide query parameters in the input fields below the query box, adding more parameters as needed with the "+" button. When you click "Execute query," the tool runs your SQL through APSW's query analysis functions and displays comprehensive information about how SQLite will execute it, including the query plan, expanded SQL, and execution details. The results are presented in a structured JSON format that shows exactly how SQLite interprets and processes your query, which is useful for understanding query performance and behavior.
