This tool allows you to progressively render and animate SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) content. You can either paste SVG code into the top textarea or load the example tiger image. Set the animation duration in seconds, then click "Render" to see the SVG gradually build up in the output area. As the animation runs, you can see both the visual result and the corresponding code updating in the live editor below. The tool also features a progress bar indicating the animation's completion status. For incomplete SVG fragments, the system automatically completes the necessary tags to ensure valid rendering. You can also edit SVG code directly in the live editor to see immediate updates in the preview area.
