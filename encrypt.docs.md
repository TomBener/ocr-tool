This tool provides secure message encryption and decryption using AES-GCM encryption. Users can encrypt messages with a passphrase, generating a URL that contains the encrypted message which can be shared with recipients. The encryption process uses PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations to derive a secure key from the passphrase, along with a random salt and initialization vector for added security. Recipients can decrypt messages by visiting the shared URL and entering the correct passphrase. All encryption and decryption occurs locally in the browser using the Web Crypto API, ensuring your messages remain private and are never sent to a server. The interface includes tabs for encrypting new messages or decrypting received messages, with copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy sharing.
