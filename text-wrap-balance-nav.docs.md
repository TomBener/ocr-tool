This interactive demonstration showcases the `text-wrap: balance` CSS property applied to a navigation bar. The page features a horizontal navigation menu with multiple link items displayed in a 400px container. Users can control two aspects of the navigation: the number of visible menu items (ranging from 4 to 14) using a slider, and whether the `text-wrap: balance` property is applied using a checkbox toggle. When enabled, the text-wrap balance property creates more visually appealing line breaks by distributing text more evenly across lines. This example helps developers understand how this CSS property affects navigation layout and readability, particularly when dealing with varying numbers of menu items in a constrained space.
