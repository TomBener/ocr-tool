The Claude Token Counter tool allows you to calculate token usage for messages sent to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Enter an optional system prompt and your user message in the respective text areas. You can also upload images and PDF files by dragging them into the designated area or clicking to select files. The tool requires an Anthropic API key (stored in your browser's local storage) and makes a request to Anthropic's token counting API. After clicking "Count Tokens," the tool displays detailed token count information, including total tokens and breakdowns by component. This helps you understand token consumption for multimodal messages before sending them to Claude, enabling better management of context limitations.
