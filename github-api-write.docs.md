This tool facilitates uploading files and images directly to GitHub repositories using the GitHub API. Enter your GitHub personal access token, repository owner, repository name, and the target file path. Choose between uploading text content or an image file - for text, enter your content in the provided textarea; for images, select a file from your device. The application converts your content to the appropriate format and sends it to GitHub using a PUT request. After successful upload, you'll receive a confirmation message with a link to view your file in the repository. This tool helps streamline the process of adding or updating files in GitHub repositories without needing to use git commands or the GitHub web interface.
