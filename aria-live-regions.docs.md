This page demonstrates how screen readers announce dynamic content changes using ARIA live regions. The demo allows users to select between "assertive" and "polite" live region types and test notifications with two buttons - one that triggers an immediate notification and another that schedules a notification after a 10-second delay. The page includes detailed instructions for testing with VoiceOver on both macOS and iOS, including keyboard shortcuts, gestures, and navigation techniques. When notifications appear, they display the current time and are announced by screen readers according to the selected live region priority. This demonstration helps developers understand how to implement accessible dynamic content updates for users who rely on assistive technologies.
