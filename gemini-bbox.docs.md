This tool helps visualize image bounding box coordinates from Google's Gemini AI models. Upload an image and enter a prompt that requests the model to identify object locations. The tool processes your image through the selected Gemini model and displays the results with colored bounding boxes drawn over the original image. The visualization includes a coordinate grid (0-1000) for precise reference. Each detected region is also extracted and displayed individually below the main image. The interface allows you to switch between different Gemini models, clear images, and visualize how the AI interprets spatial information in your images. The tool requires a Gemini API key that will be saved in your browser's local storage for convenience.
