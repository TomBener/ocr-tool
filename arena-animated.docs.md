This visualization displays the evolution of Elo ratings for top large language models based on LMSYS Chatbot Arena data. The animated chart shows how different models rank against each other over time, with higher Elo scores indicating better performance in human preference evaluations.

You can control the animation using the buttons and speed slider at the bottom. The "Reset" button restarts the animation from the beginning, while "Play/Pause" controls animation flow. The speed slider adjusts how quickly the visualization progresses through different dates.

The chart displays up to 20 models at once, sorted by their Elo scores, with colored bars representing each model. To use your own data, paste JSON in the provided text area and click "Parse JSON and Start Animation." Each data point requires a date, model name, and Elo rating.
