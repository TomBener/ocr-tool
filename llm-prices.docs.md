The LLM Pricing Calculator helps you estimate costs when using various large language models. Enter the number of input tokens (your prompts) and output tokens (AI responses), along with their respective pricing per million tokens, to calculate the total cost in both dollars and cents. The calculator includes a comprehensive list of preset pricing for popular models like GPT-4o, Claude 3, Gemini, and more. Each preset displays the cost per million tokens for both input and output, which automatically populates the calculator fields when selected. The calculator updates in real-time as you modify values, making it easy to compare costs across different models or estimate expenses for specific usage scenarios.
