The Bluesky Timeline Viewer is a web application that displays posts from your Bluesky social network timeline. After logging in with your Bluesky username/email and an app password, the application fetches and displays your timeline content. The viewer shows posts in a user-friendly format with author avatars, display names, handles, timestamps, and post text. It automatically refreshes your timeline every 10 seconds to display new content, with a countdown indicating when the next refresh will occur. You can stop the auto-refresh functionality at any time. The application saves your login credentials locally for convenience on future visits. Below the rendered timeline, the raw JSON data is also displayed for advanced users who need access to the complete API response.
