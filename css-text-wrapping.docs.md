This guide provides a comprehensive overview of CSS text wrapping properties, with detailed examples of how each property affects text display. It covers seven key properties: word-wrap/overflow-wrap (controlling how long words break when they overflow containers), word-break (specifying word break behavior, especially for non-western languages), white-space (handling spaces, tabs, and line breaks), text-overflow (indicating clipped text), hyphens (controlling hyphenation at line breaks), line-break (handling CJK text line breaks), and text-wrap (newer property for advanced wrapping control). Each section includes visual demonstrations with sample text, browser compatibility information, and tables explaining available values and their effects. The guide also contains helpful notes about property interactions, required attributes, and deprecated values to help developers implement appropriate text wrapping solutions for different scenarios.
