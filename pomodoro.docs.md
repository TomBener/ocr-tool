This Pomodoro Timer application helps users manage work sessions using the Pomodoro technique. Users can enter a goal for each session, select a timer duration (from 5 minutes to 60 minutes), and track their progress. The timer displays minutes and seconds remaining in the current session. When a session ends, it's logged in the Session Log table below, which records the goal, start time, end time, duration, and any pauses taken during the session. The app stores session data in the browser's localStorage, allowing history to persist between visits. Users can delete individual sessions from the log as needed. The bottom section displays session data in JSON format for export or reference. The timer can be controlled with on-screen buttons or by pressing the spacebar to start/pause sessions.
