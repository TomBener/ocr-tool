The Gist Audio Player is a web application that plays audio content from GitHub Gists containing OpenAI GPT-4 audio model responses. To use the player, enter a GitHub Gist URL in the input field and click "Fetch". The application extracts the base64-encoded WAV audio data from the Gist's JSON content, converts it to a playable format, and displays both the audio player and transcript. The player supports sharing via URL parameters, automatic retry for network errors, and downloading the audio file. If the Gist content is truncated, the application automatically fetches the complete raw content. The player requires Gists specifically containing JSON responses from the `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model that include an audio response with base64-encoded data.
