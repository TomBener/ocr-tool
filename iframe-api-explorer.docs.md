This page provides an API Explorer interface that allows users to make API requests to external endpoints from within a sandboxed environment. The explorer uses iframe sandboxing with the `allow-scripts` and `allow-forms` permissions to create a secure execution context. Users can enter a URL in the input field (pre-populated with a sample endpoint) and submit it to retrieve data. The application handles communication between the sandboxed iframe and the parent page using `postMessage()`, which enables the iframe to request API calls while the parent executes the actual fetch requests. The response data is displayed in a formatted JSON viewer. The iframe dynamically adjusts its height based on content through messaging to the parent window. This approach demonstrates a pattern for safely allowing API exploration while maintaining security boundaries between contexts.
