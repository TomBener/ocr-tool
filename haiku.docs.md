This web application uses your device's camera to generate haikus based on images. Capture a photo by pressing the center button, and Claude will create a haiku inspired by what it sees. For devices with multiple cameras, use the switch camera button to toggle between front and rear cameras. The application requires an Anthropic API key, which you'll be prompted to enter on first use. Generated haikus appear in the top left corner of the screen, with each new haiku added below previous ones. The application works on mobile devices and desktop browsers with camera access.
