The GitHub Issue Viewer allows you to extract the content of GitHub issues in markdown format. Enter a GitHub issue URL in the input field and click "Fetch Issue" to retrieve the issue title, status, creator, creation date, description, and all comments. You can optionally provide a GitHub Personal Access Token to access private repositories or avoid rate limiting. The token is securely stored in your browser's local storage for future use. After fetching an issue, the content is displayed in markdown format, which you can copy to your clipboard with a single click. This tool helps you document issues or share their content outside of GitHub.
