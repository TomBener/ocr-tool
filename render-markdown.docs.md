This tool renders Markdown text using GitHub's Markdown API. Enter your Markdown content in the top textarea, then click "Render" to convert it to HTML. The rendered output appears in both the lower textarea (as HTML code) and in the preview area below. You can toggle options to strip hidden HTML elements and clean up the rendered output, or enable GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) mode for additional syntax features. The tool automatically generates a table of contents from headings and preserves your content between sessions using browser storage. The HTML output can be copied for use in other applications.
