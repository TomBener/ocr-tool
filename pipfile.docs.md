This tool converts Pipfile.lock files into both Pipfile and requirements.txt formats. Paste your Pipfile.lock JSON content into the text area and click "Parse Dependencies" to extract all dependency names with their specific versions. The tool processes both default and development dependencies, displaying them in two separate formats below. Use the "Copy Pipfile Format" button to copy dependencies in the format needed for a Pipfile (`"package-name" = "==1.2.3"`), or use "Copy Requirements.txt" to copy them in the standard requirements.txt format (`package-name==1.2.3`). The parser extracts version information while properly handling the syntax differences between the formats. You can clear all content using the "Clear All" button.
